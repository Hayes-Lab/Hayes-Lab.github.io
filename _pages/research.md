This project will explore the molecular mechanisms of how microglia "remember" early life stress exposures leading to an adaptation on their life-long response to future stimuli. We will evaluate metabolic adaptations and epigenetic marks induced by maternal immune activation that persist across the lifespan of the microglia from early development to aging.
